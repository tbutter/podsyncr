= Introduction =

Podsyncr syncs all photos on your flickr account to your ipod for mobile photoset browsing.

== Supported Models ==

Currently only the iPod Nano 2nd gen. is supported. If you have any other model just send me a small sample Photo Database and I will add support for it.

= Usage =

  # Start podsyncr.jar
  # Authenticate yourself to flickr by clicking on auth and following the instructions
  # click on sync and wait
  # copy {{{"~/.podsyncr/Photo Database"}}} to the Photos directory on your ipod
  # copy {{{"~/.podsyncr/F*.ithmb"}}} to the Photos/Thumbs directory
